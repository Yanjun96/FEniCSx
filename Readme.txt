Overview
This repository is designed to model and calculate the temperature of railway brake discs using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The model incorporates heat transfer and elasticity equations to predict both temperature distribution and deformation in the brake disc during operation.

Methodology
The solution is based on the FEniCSx framework, which enables the efficient computation of coupled thermal and mechanical problems using FEM. This tool provides a powerful platform for solving complex partial differential equations, making it ideal for simulating the thermal and structural response of railway brake discs under operational loads.
