These files in therm_disc diectory are fem models which based on:
1:implicit
2:tetrahedral

For explicit and hexahedral methods, there are two directories which contains all codes. 
Implicit method is robust, tetrahedral element type has nearly same precision with tetrahedral while faster. So we choose implicit and tetrahedral as our simulation basic set up.
